The Weather Desktop Notifier is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application 
that allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city in the world. By entering a city name, 
users can get a weather report including temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and weather description. 
The app also sends desktop notifications to keep the user updated on the weather in their selected location.
